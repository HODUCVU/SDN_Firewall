1. Fix code -> Done
2. Find out all the rules for the Firewall and deploy those instances.
  - Why block that host? What packets will block and what doesn't block?
  - Check for irregularities in flows. Example: Diffrent s_ips have the same dst_ip, or One s_ips send packets to overnumber host.
  - Check payload, if packets don't have payload then this packets is potential packets attack to host/switch.
  - No need to block all packets from a host, justt block only files that are potential malicious, or block only when the file has certain properties.
3. Run real-time:
  - Connect database: sql lite
  - Connect api

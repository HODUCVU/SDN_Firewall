# Problem
* Why choice this topic.
* Advantages and disadvantages of tranditional firewall and SDN firewall.
# Solve
<!-- * Cac hinh thuc tinh cong: DoS, DDoS, **Scan port**,... -->
* How does Firewall meet the advantages of SDN and how it solve disadvantage.
* What functions does Firewall have and compare for tranditional firewall.
* Find out all the rules for the Firewall and deploy those instances.
* Use protocols :IP -> IPv4/IPv6, TCP/IP, UDP, ICMP
* Tai sao lai block host do, block nhung cai gi tu host do gui den switch.
* Why block that host? What package will block and what doesn't block?
* Check for irregularities in flows. Different s\_ips have the same dst\_ip
* Check payload, if packages don't payload then this package is potential package attack to host/switch.
* There is no need to block all packets from a host, but to optimize it, block only files that are potentially malicious, or block only when the file has certain properties.
* Run real-time

# Conclusion
* Irrelevant: tracking package's payload use 'deep package inspection' and use AI for it
